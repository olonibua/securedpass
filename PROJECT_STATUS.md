# Project Status: QR-Based Access & Attendance System

## Overview
We're building a QR-based access and attendance system with dynamic custom fields, subscription management, and email notifications. The system allows organizations to create custom check-in forms, generate QR codes for check-ins, and track attendance.

## Completed Components

### Core Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Appwrite integration for database and authentication
- ‚úÖ NextAuth.js setup for authentication
- ‚úÖ Stripe integration for subscription management
- ‚úÖ Resend email service integration
- ‚úÖ TypeScript type definitions for core entities

### Organization Management
- ‚úÖ Organization creation with type selection (company vs. membership)
- ‚úÖ Member portal for organization members

### Check-in System
- ‚úÖ Dynamic custom fields management
- ‚úÖ QR code generation API
- ‚úÖ Check-in form with dynamic fields
- ‚úÖ Check-in API endpoint
- ‚úÖ Email confirmation for check-ins

### Subscription Management
- ‚úÖ Subscription plans configuration
- ‚úÖ Stripe checkout integration
- ‚úÖ Webhook handler for subscription events
- ‚úÖ Subscription expiry reminders via cron job

### UI Components
- ‚úÖ Check-in page
- ‚úÖ Attendance table
- ‚úÖ QR code display
- ‚úÖ Subscription manager
- ‚úÖ Custom fields manager

## In Progress
- üîÑ Analytics dashboard
- üîÑ Member management interface refinements

## Pending
- ‚è≥ Mobile optimization
- ‚è≥ Export functionality for attendance data
- ‚è≥ Advanced reporting features
- ‚è≥ Multi-language support
- ‚è≥ Comprehensive testing

## Known Issues
1. Need to update all instances of `databases.Query` to `Query` after updating the appwrite.ts file
2. Some components are using `toast` from 'sonner' while others use '@/components/ui/use-toast'
3. Need to ensure consistent error handling across all components
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEPENDENCY CONFLICT**: There's a conflict between `react-day-picker` and `date-fns` versions. `react-day-picker@8.10.1` requires `date-fns@^2.28.0 || ^3.0.0` but the project is using `date-fns@^4.1.0`. Either downgrade `date-fns` to version 3.x or use `--force` flag during installation.
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **REACT VERSION COMPATIBILITY**: `react-day-picker` is not yet compatible with React 19. Consider using React 18 for better compatibility with third-party libraries.

## Next Steps
1. Complete analytics for check-in patterns
2. Refine member management functionality
3. Optimize for mobile devices
4. Write tests for critical components
5. Prepare for deployment

## Organization Types
The system now supports two distinct organization types:

### Company/Organization
- Organization manages its own members directly
- Members don't need accounts to check in
- Organization admin registers members
- Suitable for companies, schools, and events

### Membership Organization
- Users can register themselves as members
- Members have their own accounts and member portal
- Suitable for gyms, clubs, and membership-based services

## Dependencies
All required dependencies have been installed:
- next, react, react-dom
- appwrite
- next-auth
- stripe
- resend
- react-hook-form, @hookform/resolvers, zod
- @react-email/components, @react-email/tailwind
- qrcode
- shadcn/ui components
- sonner (toast notifications)

## Environment Variables
The following environment variables need to be configured:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
- NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT
- NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID
- NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID
- APPWRITE_API_KEY
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
- NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
- STRIPE_BASIC_PRICE_ID
- STRIPE_PREMIUM_PRICE_ID
- RESEND_API_KEY
- CRON_SECRET_KEY 

## Code Standards

### Type Definitions
- No duplicate type definitions across files
- Always export interfaces used across multiple files

### Code Quality
- **No undefined types**: Never use `(error)` as a catch block of a try statement or any other error emitting component in code
- **Always define error types**: All catch blocks must use `(error: unknown)` and properly type-check the error
- **Error handling pattern**: Always follow this pattern:
  ```typescript
  catch (error: unknown) {
    const errorMessage = error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Default error message';
    console.error("Descriptive context:", errorMessage);
    // Additional error handling as needed
  }
  ```
- **No unused variables**: All declared variables must be used or prefixed with underscore
- **Proper error handling**: Include try/catch blocks for async operations
- **Type safety**: Use proper TypeScript types for all variables and function parameters
- **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: No unused state variables**: Don't declare state variables (useState) without using them in the component. If you declare `setIsLoading`, you must use it in the UI (e.g., showing a loading indicator). Unused state variables cause errors during Vercel deployment.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Avoid using `any` type**: Never use the `any` type as it defeats TypeScript's type checking. Instead:
  ```typescript
  // ‚ùå Bad
  const data: any = response.data;
  
  // ‚úÖ Good
  const data: Record<string, unknown> = response.data;
  // Or use more specific types like:
  const data: CustomType = response.data;
  ```
